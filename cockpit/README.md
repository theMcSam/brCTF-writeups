# Cockpit Machine from brCTF

## Information Gathering/Reconnaissance <br>
As usual we fire up our favourite network mapper (nmap) and perform some basic recon. We can see that we have only port 80 (http) open.
`nmap -sC -sV -oN cokcpit.nmap 10.0.160.145`
```
Nmap scan report for 10.0.160.145
Host is up (0.24s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0
| http-title: Cockpit
|_Requested resource was /auth/login?to=%2F

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
```

In the second stage of out recon we checkout the application running on port `80` from our browser. <br>
We are greeted with a homepage.... interesting!

Next we try to find out what other pages are available on our target. We employ the servies of our directory bruteforcing tool (feroxbuster) or an other webfuzzer. <br>
`feroxbuster -u http://10.0.160.145 -w /raft-medium-wordlists.txt`
```

Something interesting the results above. We find a `/install` endpoint. <br>
After visiting this page in the browser we realized that the system administrator setup cockpit application without fully installing. Nice! we can abuse this. <br> After visiting this endpoint cockpit will be installed and will setup an account with default logins.

Using the default logins obtained on installation we can login to the cockpit application.
